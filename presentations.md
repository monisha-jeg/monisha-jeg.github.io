# Talks and Presentations

- ### Energy-Delay-Distortion Problem, National Conference of Communications (NCC), 2018

Presented the paper [Energy-Delay-Distortion Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05032) at the Communication Networks track at IIT Hyderabad.<br/>
The problem deals with an energy limited source transmitting varying sized but packets over a communication channel. The trade-off occurs between the number of bits to transmit (minimize cost of distortion) while considering queueing and transmission delays across all packets.

- ### GANs: A Game Theoretic Approach

Presented the work done my collating papers in deep learning and game theory to draw equivalence between GANs and two-player zero-sum games, under certain constraints. As this satisfies the conditions for the MiniMax theorem, the theoretical guarantees for convergence (minmax/maxmin values equal the value at Nash equilibrium) were shown.

- ### Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning: A Comparative Analysis

Presented a comparative [study](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UZnJpZb0DPYWtnWePfWNG3uITq_334iq) on the existing risk measures in RL like variance bounds and probabilty of risk bounds on algorithms like Q learning, SARSA and their risk-sensitive variants. <br/>
Introduced a new risk measure - euclidean distance - that maximizes distance from error states of a gridworld while minimizing travel cost, at every step.
