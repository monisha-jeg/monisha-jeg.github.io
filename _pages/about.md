<br> <br>
I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google, New York, working on [Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/), Android's native notetaking editor. I previously worked at Google Bangalore, India, where I built components of the [spelling and writing suggestion systems](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/57859?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0) for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. 

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with a Bachelor's and a Master's in Technology, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. My Master's [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IBnnL6tLmiG2SE56J1CqBcX2ZRpLk1AZ/view?usp=sharing) ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oL__61Rhwv9MtSbYKZP3dNCgDcsJbCiT/view?usp=sharing)) was on paraphrase generation with neural language models, under the mentorship of [Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/). My other explorations in the field of natural language processing include multimodal dialogue systems and text to augemented-realistic-scene conversion.

I am a practitioner of Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance form. Reading and writing are other things I do when I find myself blighted by spare time.
