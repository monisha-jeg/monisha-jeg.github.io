<br> <br>
I am a Senior Software Engineer in the _Workspace_ team at _Google, New York_, working on Keep, Android's native notetaking editor. I previously worked at 
Google, Bangalore, India, with the Editors Intelligence team, where I built spelling and writing suggestion systems for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. I graduated from the _Indian Institute of Technology Madras_ with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering.

I completed my Master's thesis on paraphrase generation with neural language models, under the mentorship of [Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov](www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/). My other explorations in the field of natural language processing include multimodal dialogue systems and text to augemented-realistic scene conversion.

I am a practitioner of Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance form.
