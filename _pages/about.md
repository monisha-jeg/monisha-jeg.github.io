I am a Software Engineer at _Google India_.

I graduated from the _Indian Institute of Technology Madras_ with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering.

My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing. I have worked on paraphrase generation, cognitive language modelling, text to scene conversion, neural language models, and multimodal dialogue systems. I completed my Master's thesis under the mentorship of [Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov](www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/), _Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University_. I have also worked with [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) at the _Indian Institute of Technology Madras_ and [Prof. Veni Madhavan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/people/people-faculty-cevm.html) at the _Indian Institute of Science_.
