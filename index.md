# ABOUT ME

Hi, I am a Dual Degree graduate from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I have interned at the Indian Institute of Science, Adobe Research Labs and Google India. I would soon be starting my full-time role as a Software Development Engineer in Google, Bangalore.

My primary research interest is Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. I have worked on projects such on paraphrase generation, cognitive modelling, text to scene conversion, neural language models, and multimodal dialogue systems. I completed my Master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov](www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/), Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I have also worked with [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) at the Indian Institute of Technology and [Prof. Veni Madhavan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/people/people-faculty-cevm.html) at the Indian Institute of Science. 

I am a practitioner of the classical dance form of Bharatanatyam. I am an acquisitive reader, historical fiction being my favourite genre. I also write articles, book reviews and short stories on my [personal blog](https://accioredmoon.blogspot.com/).
